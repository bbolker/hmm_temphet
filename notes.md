#Fig 1 
consistency with vdk
homog: BIC - optimal number (mostly) doesn't depend on the model 
het : doesn't dep on model + BIC-opt

#Fig 2

heterogeneity, HMM best HMM vs FMM > TH 
TH is good with good models (quad,sin)
(hourly too complicated)
BIC optimal number 5 for best models 

#Fig 3
TH can capture diurnal variation (without viterbi)
homog HMM/FMM can't 

#Fig 4 
TH can capture short-term autocorrelation (without Viterbi) FMM can't 

#Fig 5 
Double check with other cats
In general, models with more states break up short-distance clusters
