	abstract = {Recent theory suggests that animals should switch facultatively among canonical movement modes as a complex function of internal state, landscape characteristics, motion capacity, and navigational capacity. We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1–3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested.},

	abstract = {We investigate the transmission dynamics of a certain type of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus under experimental conditions. Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homo-geneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus., but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to investigate the posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the infection chain on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value. Parameter estimates of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are also obtained. The results reveal a possible decline in viraemia in one of the two experimental outbreaks. Our model also suggests that individual infectivity is related to the level of viraemia.},

Although HMMs have been used successfully to infer use of space by individual woodland caribou, their behavioral states remained hidden. In our study, global positioning satellite (GPS) radio-collars allowed us to derive data (distance-between-locations, turning angle and travel rate) meaningful to hidden Markov modeling techniques. Aerial relocation allowed confirmation of kill-site locations (uncover the hidden states). The primary objective of our study was to evaluate whether HMMs could predict observer-confirmed kill-sites solely from the GPS wolf relocation data (correctly discover the hidden states). The Markov structure inherent in the HMMs provided additional insight into wolf behavior, such as bedding and relocating. We discuss the potential of using HMMs to determine predation rates on populations of wild ungulates and compare model signatures between packs preying on different ungulate species.},

Using a combination of computer simulations and micro-landscape experiments with Tribolium confusum beetles we found that conventional correlated random walk models with constant parameters severely underestimated spatial spread because organisms changed movement behaviors over time. However, a model incorporating behavioral heterogeneity between individuals, and within individuals over time, was able to account for observed patterns of spread. Our results suggest that the main challenge for scaling up movement patterns resides in the complexities of individual behavior rather than in the spatial structure of the landscape.},

	abstract = {Movement has important consequences for individual and population-level processes, but methods are only starting to become available for quantifying fine-scale movement paths of smaller animals. New techniques for inferring behavioral states and their relation to social and environmental factors provide a powerful way to test the influence of such factors on individuals. One such technique that has recently gained popularity is the use of hidden Markov models, which link time series of movement variables and the underlying behavioral states of individuals. We used hidden Markov models to evaluate behavioral states and their relation to environmental, seasonal, and social factors in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) while accounting for individual heterogeneity with discrete random effects. We identified 2 distinct behavioral states, resting and foraging, which were related to covariates in our models. Using this approach, we concluded that woodpecker step lengths tended to be longest in winter, larger groups of woodpeckers tended to spend less time foraging and more time resting when compared with smaller groups, and woodpeckers foraged more and rested less when in higher-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the impact that social and environmental factors can have on movement in a social species and, thus, reinforce the importance of including these factors in animal movement studies. The extensions of basic hidden Markov models considered here may prove valuable in forthcoming studies that involve high-resolution tracking to understand behavior of birds and other small animals.},

In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.},

Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homo-geneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus., but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to investigate the posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the infection chain on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value. Parameter estimates of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are also obtained. The results reveal a possible decline in viraemia in one of the two experimental outbreaks. Our model also suggests that individual infectivity is related to the level of viraemia.},

	abstract = {A frailty model is a random effects model for time variables, where the random effect (the frailty) has a multiplicative effect on the hazard. It can be used for univariate (independent) failure times, i.e. to describe the influence of unobserved covariates in a proportional hazards model. More interesting, however, is to consider multivariate (dependent) failure times generated as conditionally independent times given the frailty. This approach can be used both for survival times for individuals, like twins or family members, and for repeated events for the same individual. The standard assumption is to use a gamma distribution for the frailty, but this is a restriction that implies that the dependence is most important for late events. More generally, the distribution can be stable, inverse Gaussian, or follow a power variance function exponential family. Theoretically, large differences are seen between the choices. In practice, using the largest model makes it possible to allow for more general dependence structures, without making the formulas too complicated.},

	abstract = {The first edition of Multivariate Statistical Modelling provided an extension of classical models for regression, time series, and longitudinal data to a much broader class including categorical data and smoothing concepts. Generalized linear modesl for univariate and multivariate analysis build the central concept, which for the modelling of complex data is widened to much more general modelling approaches. The primary aim of the new edition is to bring the book up-to-date and to reflect the major new developments over the past years. The authors give a detailed introductory survey of the subject based on the alaysis of real data drawn from a variety of subjects, including the biological sciences, economics, and the social sciences. Technical details and proofs are deferred to an appendix in order to provide an accessible account for non-experts. The appendix serves as a reference or brief tutorial for the concepts of EM algorithm, numberical integration, MCMC and others. The topics covered inlude: Models for multi-categorial responses, model checking, semi- and nonparametric modelling, time series and longitudinal data, random effects models, state-space models, and survival analysis. In the new edition Bayesian concepts which are of growing importance in statistics are treated more extensively. The chapter on nonparametric and semiparametric generalized regression has been rewritten totally, random effects models now cover nonparametric maximum likelihood and fully Bayesian approaches, and state-space and hidden Markov models have been supplemented with an extension to models that can accommodate for spatial and spatiotemporal data. The authors have taken great pains to discuss the underlying theoretical ideas in ways that relate well to the data at hand. As a result, this book is ideally suited for applied statisticians, graduate students of statistics, and students and researchers with a strong interest in statistics and data analysis from econometrics, biometrics and the social sciences.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)},

	abstract = {Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, Lévy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

	abstract = {Horizontal plasmid transfer plays a key role in bacterial adaptation. In harsh environments, bacterial populations adapt by sampling genetic material from a horizontal gene pool through self-transmissible plasmids, and that allows persistence of these mobile genetic elements. In the absence of selection for plasmid-encoded traits it is not well understood if and how plasmids persist in bacterial communities. Here we present three models of the dynamics of plasmid persistence in the absence of selection. The models consider plasmid loss (segregation), plasmid cost, conjugative plasmid transfer and observation error. Also, we present a stochastic model in which the relative fitness of the plasmid free cells was modeled as a random variable affected by an environmental process using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Extensive simulations showed that the estimates from the proposed model are nearly unbiased. Likelihood Ratio Tests showed that the dynamics of plasmid persistence are strongly dependent on the host type. Accounting for stochasticity was necessary to explain 4 out of 7 time series data sets, thus confirming that plasmid persistence needs to be understood as a stochastic process. This work can be viewed as a conceptual starting point under which new plasmid persistence hypotheses can be tested.},

	abstract = {Analysing behavioural sequences and quantifying the likelihood of occurrences of different behaviours is a difficult task as motivational states are not observable. Furthermore, it is ecologically highly relevant and yet more complicated to scale an appropriate model for one individual up to the population level. In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.},

It can be used for univariate (independent) failure times, i.e. to describe the influence of unobserved covariates in a proportional hazards model. More interesting, however, is to consider multivariate (dependent) failure times generated as conditionally independent times given the frailty. This approach can be used both for survival times for individuals, like twins or family members, and for repeated events for the same individual. The standard assumption is to use a gamma distribution for the frailty, but this is a restriction that implies that the dependence is most important for late events. More generally, the distribution can be stable, inverse Gaussian, or follow a power variance function exponential family. Theoretically, large differences are seen between the choices. In practice, using the largest model makes it possible to allow for more general dependence structures, without making the formulas too complicated.},

We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1–3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested.},

	abstract = {Horizontal plasmid transfer plays a key role in bacterial adaptation. In harsh environments, bacterial populations adapt by sampling genetic material from a horizontal gene pool through self-transmissible plasmids, and that allows persistence of these mobile genetic elements. In the absence of selection for plasmid-encoded traits it is not well understood if and how plasmids persist in bacterial communities. Here we present three models of the dynamics of plasmid persistence in the absence of selection. The models consider plasmid loss (segregation), plasmid cost, conjugative plasmid transfer and observation error. Also, we present a stochastic model in which the relative fitness of the plasmid free cells was modeled as a random variable affected by an environmental process using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Extensive simulations showed that the estimates from the proposed model are nearly unbiased. Likelihood Ratio Tests showed that the dynamics of plasmid persistence are strongly dependent on the host type. Accounting for stochasticity was necessary to explain 4 out of 7 time series data sets, thus confirming that plasmid persistence needs to be understood as a stochastic process. This work can be viewed as a conceptual starting point under which new plasmid persistence hypotheses can be tested.},

	abstract = {The first edition of Multivariate Statistical Modelling provided an extension of classical models for regression, time series, and longitudinal data to a much broader class including categorical data and smoothing concepts. Generalized linear modesl for univariate and multivariate analysis build the central concept, which for the modelling of complex data is widened to much more general modelling approaches. The primary aim of the new edition is to bring the book up-to-date and to reflect the major new developments over the past years. The authors give a detailed introductory survey of the subject based on the alaysis of real data drawn from a variety of subjects, including the biological sciences, economics, and the social sciences. Technical details and proofs are deferred to an appendix in order to provide an accessible account for non-experts. The appendix serves as a reference or brief tutorial for the concepts of EM algorithm, numberical integration, MCMC and others. The topics covered inlude: Models for multi-categorial responses, model checking, semi- and nonparametric modelling, time series and longitudinal data, random effects models, state-space models, and survival analysis. In the new edition Bayesian concepts which are of growing importance in statistics are treated more extensively. The chapter on nonparametric and semiparametric generalized regression has been rewritten totally, random effects models now cover nonparametric maximum likelihood and fully Bayesian approaches, and state-space and hidden Markov models have been supplemented with an extension to models that can accommodate for spatial and spatiotemporal data. The authors have taken great pains to discuss the underlying theoretical ideas in ways that relate well to the data at hand. As a result, this book is ideally suited for applied statisticians, graduate students of statistics, and students and researchers with a strong interest in statistics and data analysis from econometrics, biometrics and the social sciences.},

	abstract = {The use of miniature data loggers is rapidly increasing our understanding of the movements and habitat preferences of pelagic seabirds. However, objectively interpreting behavioural information from the large volumes of highly detailed data collected by such devices can be challenging. We combined three biologging technologies—global positioning system (GPS), saltwater immersion and time–depth recorders—to build a detailed picture of the at-sea behaviour of the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) during the breeding season. We used a hidden Markov model to explore discrete states within the combined GPS and immersion data, and found that behaviour could be organized into three principal activities representing (i) sustained direct flight, (ii) sitting on the sea surface, and (iii) foraging, comprising tortuous flight interspersed with periods of immersion. The additional logger data verified that the foraging activity corresponded well to the occurrence of diving. Applying this approach to a large tracking dataset revealed that birds from two different colonies foraged in local waters that were exclusive, but overlapped in one key area: the Irish Sea Front (ISF). We show that the allocation of time to each activity differed between colonies, with birds breeding furthest from the ISF spending the greatest proportion of time engaged in direct flight and the smallest proportion of time engaged in foraging activity. This type of analysis has considerable potential for application in future biologging studies and in other taxa.},

Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.


* Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.

To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.

	abstract = {An individual’s choices are shaped by its experience, a fundamental property of behavior important to understanding complex processes. Learning and memory are observed across many taxa and can drive behaviors, including foraging behavior. To explore the conditions under which memory provides an advantage, we present a continuous-space, continuous-time model of animal movement that incorporates learning and memory. Using simulation models, we evaluate the benefit memory provides across several types of landscapes with variable-quality resources and compare the memory model within a nested hierarchy of simpler models (behavioral switching and random walk). We find that memory almost always leads to improved foraging success, but that this effect is most marked in landscapes containing sparse, contiguous patches of high-value resources that regenerate relatively fast and are located in an otherwise devoid landscape. In these cases, there is a large payoff for finding a resource patch, due to size, value, or locational difficulty. While memory-informed search is difficult to differentiate from other factors using solely movement data, our results suggest that disproportionate spatial use of higher value areas, higher consumption rates, and consumption variability all point to memory influencing the movement direction of animals in certain ecosystems.},

Can the pursuit of the true model also lead to optimal regression estimation? In model selection, it is well known that BIC is consistent in selecting the true model, and AIC is minimax-rate optimal for estimating the regression function. A recent promising direction is adaptive model selection, in which, in contrast to AIC and BIC, the penalty term is data-dependent. Some theoretical and empirical results have been obtained in support of adaptive model selection, but it is still not clear if it can really share the strengths of AIC and BIC. Model combining or averaging has attracted increasing attention as a means to overcome the model selection uncertainty. Can Bayesian model averaging be optimal for estimating the regression function in a minimax sense? We show that the answers to these questions are basically in the negative: for any model selection criterion to be consistent, it must behave suboptimally for estimating the regression function in terms of minimax rate of covergence; and Bayesian model averaging cannot be minimax-rate optimal for regression estimation.},
